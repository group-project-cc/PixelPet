# PixelPet

_What is PixelPet_?

PixelPet is an all-in-one therapeutic solution to all of life's problems in the form of a desktop app that houses **Pixel Animated Pets!** 🦉🐶😺🪰 

<br>

- Feed them.
- Pet them.
- Play with them.

- **Dress them up with COSMETICS! 🧥**

<br>

Your pets are always there on your screen even if you're blankly staring at it, wondering why your 'print("Hello World")' is taking 22 minutes to run. <br>
<br>
